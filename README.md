1.  Develop proficiency in **Markdown** for effective documentation and communication.
2.  Gain practical experience and a strong understanding of **GitHub** for version control and collaboration.
3.  Enhance **Python** programming skills relevant to AI applications in the arts and humanities.
4.  Build foundational **Coding** competence for implementing AI-related tasks and projects.

## Content of this Repository

This repository will contain:

* This README file.
* My 3 Python notebooks that reflect my work I've done in the labs.
* Any supplementary data or resources used in the completion of these tasks.
