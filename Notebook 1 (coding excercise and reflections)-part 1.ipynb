    "\n",
    "1.  **Defining a Class:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Greeting:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This line defines a new class named `Greeting`. A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **The `__init__` Method (Constructor):**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    The `__init__` method is called when a new object of the class is created. It initializes the object with data, specifically the `message` parameter.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    self.message = message\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This line assigns the `message` passed to the constructor to an instance variable `message`. The `self` parameter refers to the object itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Defining a Method:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def say_hello(self):\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This defines a method called `say_hello`. A method is a function that belongs to an object of the class and operates on the object's attributes.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(self.message)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This line prints the value stored in the `message` attribute of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Creating an Object:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    hello_world = Greeting(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This creates an object of the `Greeting` class. The string `\"Hello, world!\"` is passed to the `__init__` method, which initializes the object's `message` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Calling a Method:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    hello_world.say_hello()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This calls the `say_hello` method on the `hello_world` object, which prints the message stored in the object's `message` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class:**\n",
    "    A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects will have. For example, the `Greeting` class defines a method `say_hello()` and an attribute `message`.\n",
    "* **Object:**\n",
    "    An object is an instance of a class. In the code, `hello_world` is an object of the `Greeting` class.\n",
    "* **Method:**\n",
    "    A method is a function defined inside a class. It operates on instances of the class and can access the instance’s attributes. The `say_hello` method prints the `message` attribute of the `hello_world` object.\n",
    "* **Initializer (`__init__`):**\n",
    "    The `__init__` method is a special method called the constructor. It is executed when a new object is created from the class and initializes the object with default or provided values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "* I learned how to define a class in Python and create objects from that class.\n",
    "* I now understand how to use the `__init__` method to initialize objects with specific attributes.\n",
    "* I understand that methods are functions inside classes that can operate on objects.\n",
    "* I learned how to instantiate objects and call methods on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "I initially found the concept of classes and objects difficult, but after using GitHub Copilot to break it down further, I gained a better understanding. I now feel comfortable with the basic structure of object-oriented programming in Python.\n",
